Runing Python Script in the Command Line With Shabang Line

Shebang Line
A shebang line is a special line at the beginning of your Python program that tells your computer which interpreter to use to run the script. It starts with #!.

Why Use a Shebang Line:

Itâ€™s needed if you want to run your Python script directly from the command line without having to specify the Python interpreter each time.
Shebang Line Depending on Operating System:
Windows: #! python3
OS X (Mac): #! /usr/bin/env python3
Linux: #! /usr/bin/python3


Running Python Programs on Windows

Python Interpreter Location: On Windows, the Python interpreter for Python 3.4 is located at C:\Python34\python.exe.

Using py.exe:
py.exe is a convenient program that reads the shebang line in your script and runs the appropriate version of Python.
If you have multiple Python versions installed, py.exe ensures the correct version runs your script.
Creating a Batch File:

A batch file is a text file that contains commands to be executed by the command prompt.
To make a batch file to run your Python script:
Create a new text file.
Write the following line in it:

@py.exe C:\path\to\your\pythonScript.py %*


Replace C:\path\to\your\pythonScript.py with the actual path to your script.

Save this file with a .bat extension (e.g., pythonScript.bat).

Using the Batch File: You can run your Python script by simply double-clicking the batch file or typing its name in the command prompt.
